'''Warning:''' the following instructions apply to the '''Trac web application itself''', ''not'' to the actual software being managed by this instance of Trac. Check the project's WikiStart page for pointers to the relevant support information.
----

Like in most [http://www.opensource.org/ open source projects], "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/MailingList mailing list] and the project wiki.

There is also an [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the appropriate searching:
 * in the project's [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracFaq FAQ]
 * in past messages to the Trac [http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.trac.general?set_user_css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edgewall.com%2Fcss%2Fgmane.css&do_set_user_css=t Mailing List]
 * in the Trac ticket system, using either a [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/search?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on full search] or a [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/query?summary=~&keywords=~" ticket query].
