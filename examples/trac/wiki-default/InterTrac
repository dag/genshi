= InterTrac Extension for TracLinks =

''(since [milestone:0.10])''

== Definitions ==

An InterTrac link is used for referring to a Trac object 
(Wiki page, changeset, ticket, ...) located in another
Trac environment.

== List of Active InterTrac Prefixes ==

[[InterTrac]]

== Link Syntax ==

{{{
<target_environment>:<TracLinks>
}}}

The link is composed by the target environment name, 
followed by a colon (e.g. `trac:`),
followed by a regular TracLinks, of any flavor.

That target environment name is either the real name of the 
environment, or an alias for it. 
The aliases are defined in `trac.ini` (see below).
The prefix is case insensitive.

For convenience, there's also an alternative short-hand form, 
where one can use an alias as an immediate prefix 
for the identifier of a ticket, changeset or report:
(e.g. `#T234`, `[T1508]`, `[trac 1508]`, ...)

== Configuration ==

It is necessary to setup a specific `[intertrac]` section in the TracIni for the InterTrac facility, in order to associate a prefix to other Trac sites, and for defining environment aliases.

Example configuration:
{{{
...
[intertrac]
## -- Example of setting up an alias:
t = trac

## -- Link to an external Trac:
trac.title = Edgewall's Trac for Trac
trac.url = http://projects.edgewall.com/trac

#trac.svn = http://repos.edgewall.com/projects/trac 
# Hint: .svn information could be used in the future to support svn:externals...
}}}

Now, given this configuration, one could create the following links:
 * to the current InterTrac page:
   * `trac:wiki:InterTrac` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/InterTrac trac:wiki:InterTrac]
   * `t:wiki:InterTrac` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/InterTrac t:wiki:InterTrac]
   * Keys are case insensitive: `T:wiki:InterTrac` -> 
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/InterTrac T:wiki:InterTrac]
 * to the ticket #234:
   * `trac:ticket:234` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/234 trac:ticket:234]
   * `trac:#234` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/234 trac:#234]
   * `#T234` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/search?q=#234 #T234]
 * to the changeset [1912]:
   * `trac:changeset:1912` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/changeset/1912 trac:changeset:1912]
   * `trac:[1912]` ->
     [http:"//projects.edgewall.com/trac/search?q=[1912]" "trac:[1912]"]
   * `[T1912]` ->
     [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/changeset/1912 "[T1912]"]

Anything not given as explicit links (intertrac_prefix:module:id)
is interpreted by the remote Trac, relying on its quickjump
facility.
