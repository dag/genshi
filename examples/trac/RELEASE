Trac 0.9.5 Release Notes
============================
April 18, 2006

We're proud to present our latest release - Trac 0.9.5.

Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system, integrated with
Subversion, for software development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic
approach to web-based software project management. Our mission is simple; to
help developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should
impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and
policies.

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating
links and useful structure between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline view presents all project events in chronological order,
making tracking progress or getting an overview of a project easy.

For more information, please visit the main Trac web site:

available at:

Acknowledgements
----------------
Many thanks to the growing number of people who have, and continue to,
support the project. Also our thanks to all people providing feedback and bug
reports that helps us make Trac better, easier to use and more effective.

Without your invaluable help, Trac would not evolve. Thank you all.

Finally, we offer hope that Trac will prove itself useful to like-minded
programmers around the world, and that this release will prove an improvement
over the last version.

Please let us know. :-)
