Version 0.3
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.0/
(Sep 17 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * The project name was changed from "Markup" to "Genshi". See UPGRADE.txt
   for upgrade instructions.
 * Expression evaluation now differentiates between undefined variables and
   variables that are defined but set to `None`. This also means that local
   variables can override built-ins even if the local variable are set to
   `None` (ticket #36).
 * The plugin implementation now makes more functions available for use inside
   templates: XML(), HTML(), defined(), and value-of(). These are mostly for
   migration from Kid.
 * The parsing of `py:with` directives has been improved: you can now assign
   to multiple names, and semicolons inside string literals are treated as
   expected.
 * Generator expressions can now be used in template expressions (ticket #16).
 * Added serialization to plain text (ticket #41).
 * Calling functions from template expressions with *args and/or **kwargs
   now works correctly (ticket #42).
 * The `TemplateLoader` class and the `Template` instances that it manages are
   now thread-safe, as they no longer keep any state related to the current
   processing context.
 * Stream filters and serializers can now be applied using the "pipe" (bitwise
   or) operator "|".
 * The execution of named template functions (`py:def`) no longer silently
   swallows TypeError exceptions (ticket #44).
 * The XML Parser now correctly handles unicode input (ticket #43).
 * HTML entities can now be used in templates without having to declare an HTML
   document type.
 * Error reporting on undefined entities has been fixed.
 * Fix traversal of substreams by XPath expressions. For example, the path
   '*/*' no longer matches non-immediate child elements, and '@*' no longer
   matches the attributes of descendants.
 * Fixes for `py:match` which would get confused when it should be applied
   to multiple elements (ticket #49).
 * Using namespace prefixes in XPath expressions is now supported.
 * Expressions now correctly handle slices (ticket #51).
 * A simple text-based template language is now included for generating
   plain text output (ticket #47).


Version 0.2
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.2.0/
(Aug 22 2006, from branches/stable/0.2.x)

 * XPath syntax errors now contain position info (ticket #20).
 * Errors in expression evaluation now contain the correct line number in the
   template (ticket #22).
 * <script> and <style> element contents are no longer escaped when using HTML
   serialization (ticket #24).
 * In some cases expressions in templates did not get interpolated (ticket
   #26).
 * CDATA sections are now passed through the pipeline and serialized correctly.
   That allows using <script> or <style> elements in XHTML output that is still
   compatible with HTML user agents.
 * The XHTML serializer now correctly handles elements in foreign namespaces
   (such as SVG or MathML).
 * Fixed relative includes in templates on Windows (ticket #27).
 * Output can be encoded using legacy codecs such as ISO-8859-1. Any character
   not representable in the chosen encoding gets replaced by the corresponding
   XML character reference.
 * String literals in XPath expressions that contain spaces are now parsed
   as expected.
 * Added support for the XPath functions boolean(), ceiling(), concat(),
   contains(), false(), floor(), normalize-space(), number(), round(),
   starts-with(), string-length(), substring(), substring-after(),
   substring-before(), translate(), and true().
 * Non-ASCII characters in expressions should now be handled correctly (ticket
   #29).
 * Default values for arguments of template functions now also work with
   constants and complex expressions (they only worked for string or number
   literals before).
 * XPath expressions in now support XPath variables ($var) in predicates
   (ticket #31).
 * Expressions in templates can now span multiple lines if they are enclosed
   in curly braces.
 * py:def macros can now be invoked from within expressions inside attribute
   values (ticket #34).
