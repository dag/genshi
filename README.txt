About Markup
============

Markup is a Python library that provides an integrated set of components
for parsing, generating, and processing HTML or XML content in a uniform
manner. The major feature is a template language that is heavily inspired
by Kid.


Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python, version 2.3 or later (version 2.4 or later is recommended)
 * Optional: setuptools 0.6a2 or later


Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked a Markup source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

  $ python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
it will by default attempt to install Markup to the Python site-packages
directory on your system.
